# Involucrate

## Idea

Involucrate is the concept of a platform that brings people together who have ideas but can not
execute these on their own. They search for like-minded people and by this, Involucrate brings back
a feeling of companionship around your neighbourhood and municipal.
At the same time, Involucrate offers the opportunity to discuss recent events and problems while
also offering a structured way to come to productive conclusions together.
Last but not least, it offers people who would like to get involved with political and municipal
associations a tool to find the perfect fits for them so that the society becomes closer and
more familiar again.

## Functionalities

* The main page is the project feed where we can search for random projects in our proximity or for
projects that suit our preferences.
    * Inside these projects we can discuss the details in a public comment section. If the creator of the project finds our ideas interesting, he can invite us to
be part of the project, then we are able to discuss the project in a separate comment section.
    * We can also filter, if we are interested in participating in planning the event or if we
    merely want to help.
    * More detailed filter, i.e. which topics we prefer or the extend of the project size are also
    possible
* Similar to the project feed we do also offer a feed for discussions
    * Again, we can apply filter or we change the feed to an "Engagement feed" so that we can
    discover associations close to us, which might interest us
* All three types can be created by yourself in the "Create New" part. There we offer templates so that
people can make use of concepts or structures which have been used successfully in the past. This makes
things easier and strengthens the community.
* Events, that are finished with their planing, will be put into the calendar. Everyone, who just wants
to see if there are any events in the near future which might interest him/her, will find a easy to use
tool to filter and get more information via the calendar
* The profile is not supposed to be as important as on other platforms. It is rather just an opportunity
to tell the world a few things about you, if you think this might help your credibility. But we do not
want anyone to feel obligated to write a lot on his profile.
* Sub On the profile page we do also manage the projects we currently participate. There we can instantly
access the "hidden" part of the project, where the serious planning takes place.

## Technology

This is just a prototype, developed in Dart and Flutter. The real application will probably be done
with Firebase as backend.

## Launching the project

Only the most recent Android Studio and an emulator are needed. No specialities.

## Screenshots

Some screenshot to get an idea of the project.
