# involucrate

Platform concept to structure project ideas, concepts and engagement possibilities

# TODOs:

- Kai ought to familiarize himself with the code and play around with the programming language
  and the possibilities/limits.
- All the functionalities we talked about and recorded in notion are supposed to be implemented.
  In the first place the UI is not that important. We will choose a uniform UI later on. Right now
  the most important part is programming all the logic.
- The Drawer does not lead anywhere yet. We should implement the function in a way that the pageView
  is being updated to show the profile while the bottomNavBar stays the same. We can also discuss, if
  it would not be better to lead to a completely new page for the profile. I am looking at reddit and see
  that the profile is the only page that keeps the bottomNavBar. All the other pages drop it and make
  room for displaying more data.



- I have yet to implement the providers to fetch the data from firebase and then
  distribute it to the different screens. Until then we work mit mock-data
